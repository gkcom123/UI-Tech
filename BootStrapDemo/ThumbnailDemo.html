            <blockquote>
                <p>“First off, location, location, location! The Landon Hotel in Vienna is located in a wonderfully picturesque part of town. The staff were polite and friendly, and the neighborhood really did feel welcoming. I even ended up extending my stay, and the hotel staff made all the arrangements! Can't wait to make my way out to the Landon in Vienna again.” </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>“The Landon hotel in San Francisco is a great place to stay if you're looking to be in the heart of the city, and can’t afford to break the bank. They even had bike storage on the mezzanine, which made it easy to explore the city on bicycle. The front desk staff were always helpful, and made checking in and out a pleasurable experience. The room’s modern decor and extra amenities were the icing on the cake.”</p>
