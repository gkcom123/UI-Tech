  /*
   The reason for this has to do with the fact that semicolons are technically optional in JavaScript
   (although omitting them is generally really bad form). As a result, when the line containing the
   return statement (with nothing else on the line) is encountered in foo2(), a semicolon is automatically
   inserted immediately after the return statement.
   No error is thrown since the remainder of the code is perfectly valid, even though it
   doesn’t ever get invoked or do anything (it is simply an unused code block that defines a property bar
   which is equal to the string "hello").

  /*
   An educated answer to this question would simply be: “You can’t be sure. it might print out
   “0.3” and “true”, or it might not. Numbers in JavaScript are all treated with floating point precision,
   and as such, may not always yield the expected results.”
